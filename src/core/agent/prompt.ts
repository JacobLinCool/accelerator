    2. **Skill Alignment**: Does this task match the engineer's strengths or provide valuable growth?
    3. **Project Velocity**: Does this assignment help move the project forward efficiently?
    4. **Workload Balance**: Is this engineer's current capacity appropriate for this task?
    5. **Team Dynamics**: Will this assignment strengthen collaboration and knowledge sharing?
    6. **Long-term Development**: Does this contribute to the engineer's career growth?
    
    ## Key Principles
    - **People First**: Technology serves people, not the other way around
